## Form and Scaffold Utilities for Golang

This project contains 2 main components:

 * `scaffold` generates files or entire directory hierarchies from complex data
 * `forms` is a guided input form system for the terminal that can generate arbitrarily nested complex data

Together they allow building Wizard-style file generators.

See [App Builder](https://github.com/choria-io/appbuilder) for these projects in use in an end-user product.
